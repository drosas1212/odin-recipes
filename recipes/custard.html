        <p> <h2>Description</h2> 
            This custard recipe is a combination of a few different recipes. 
            It's not too rich or too sweet. 
            Can be served warm immediately or cold.    
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan. 
                Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering; 
                remove from heat before it comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Set the saucepan back over low heat. 
                Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, 
                until custard thickens enough to coat the bottom of a spoon, 
                5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or transfer custard into a large bowl, cover, 
                and allow to cool before chilling.</li>
        </ol>
