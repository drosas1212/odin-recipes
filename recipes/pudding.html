        <p> <h2>Description</h2> 
            This homemade pudding with vanilla is a rich and delectable dessert.  
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk: This recipe starts with two cups of milk heated on the stove.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Sweeten the pudding with ½ cup of white sugar.</li>
            <li>Cornstarch: Three tablespoons of cornstarch thickens the vanilla pudding.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavor, but it won’t make the pudding taste salty.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Of course, you’ll need vanilla extract!</li>
            <li>Butter: A tablespoon of butter takes the rich vanilla pudding up a notch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the milk until bubbles form at the edges.</li>
            <li>Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar mixture to the milk, a little at a time, stirring until thick.</li>
            <li>Remove the pudding from the heat, then stir in the butter and vanilla.</li>
        </ol>
